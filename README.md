# [<img src="https://ipinfo.io/static/ipinfo-small.svg" alt="IPinfo" width="24"/>](https://ipinfo.io/) IPinfo PHP Client Library

This is the official PHP client library for the [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) IP address API, allowing you to lookup your own IP address, or get any of the following details for an IP:
 - IP geolocation (city, region, country, postal code, latitude and longitude)
 - ASN details (ISP or network operator, associated domain name, and type, such as business, hosting or company)
 - Company details (the name and domain of the business that uses the IP address)
 - Carrier details (the name of the mobile carrier and MNC and MCC for that carrier if the IP is used exclusively for mobile traffic)



### Getting Started

You'll need an IPinfo API access token, which you can get by singing up for a free account at [https://ipinfo.io/signup](https://ipinfo.io/signup?ref=lib-PHP).

The free plan is limited to 1,000 requests a day, and doesn't include some of the data fields such as IP type and company data. To enable all the data fields and additional request volumes see [https://ipinfo.io/pricing](https://ipinfo.io/pricing?ref=lib-PHP).

#### Installation

```
composer require ipinfo/ipinfo
```

#### Quick Start

```
>>>use ipinfo\ipinfo\IPinfo;

>>> $access_token = '123456789abc';
>>> $client = new IPinfo($access_token);
>>> $ip_address = '216.239.36.21';
>>> $details = $client->getDetails($ip_address);

>>> $detail->city;
Emeryville
>>> $details->loc;
37.8342,-122.2900
```

### Installation

```
>>> composer require ipinfo/ipinfo
```

### Usage

The `IPinfo->getDetails()` method accepts an IP address as an optional, positional argument. If no IP address is specified, the API will return data for the IP address from which it receives the request.

```
>>> $client = new IPinfo();
>>> $ip_address = '216.239.36.21';
>>> $details = $client->getDetails($ip_address);
>>> $detail->city;
Emeryville
>>> $details->loc;
37.8342,-122.2900
```

### Guzzle Options
You can configure the options of [Guzzle HTTP Client](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) which is used for making the API calls. Just pass the options array as the third argument to the `IPinfo` constructor. For example, if you want to specify a 3.5 seconds timeout of the API request:

```
>>> $client = new IPinfo(null, [], ['timeout'  => 3.5]);
```

A full list of available options are specified in the [Guzzle Documentation](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/request-options.html).
 
### Authentication

The IPinfo library can be authenticated with your IPinfo API token, which is passed in as a positional argument. It also works without an authentication token, but in a more limited capacity.

```
>>> $access_token = '123456789abc';
>>> $client = new IPinfo($access_token);
```

### Details Data

`IPinfo->getDetails()` will return a `Details` object that contains all fields listed [IPinfo developer docs](https://ipinfo.io/developers/responses#full-response) with a few minor additions. Properties can be accessed directly.

```
>>> $details->hostname;
cpe-104-175-221-247.socal.res.rr.com
```

#### Country Name

``Details->country_name`` will return the country name, as supplied by the ``countries.json`` file. See below for instructions on changing that file for use with non-English languages. ``Details->country`` will still return country code.

```
>>> $details->country;
US
>>> $details->country_name;
United States
```

#### Longitude and Latitude

``Details->latitude`` and ``Details->longitude`` will return latitude and longitude, respectively, as strings. ``Details->loc`` will still return a composite string of both values.

```
>>> $details->loc;
34.0293,-118.3570
>>> $details->latitude;
34.0293
>>> $details->longitude;
-118.3570
```

#### Accessing all properties

``Details->all`` will return all details data as a dictionary.

```
>>> $details->all;
    {
    'asn': {  'asn': 'AS20001',
               'domain': 'twcable.com',
               'name': 'Time Warner Cable Internet LLC',
               'route': '104.172.0.0/14',
               'type': 'isp'},
    'city': 'Los Angeles',
    'company': {   'domain': 'twcable.com',
                   'name': 'Time Warner Cable Internet LLC',
                   'type': 'isp'},
    'country': 'US',
    'country_name': 'United States',
    'hostname': 'cpe-104-175-221-247.socal.res.rr.com',
    'ip': '104.175.221.247',
    'loc': '34.0293,-118.3570',
    'latitude': '34.0293',
    'longitude': '-118.3570',
    'phone': '323',
    'postal': '90016',
    'region': 'California'
    }
```

### Caching

In-memory caching of `Details` data is provided by default via the [sabre/cache](https://github.com/sabre-io/cache/) library. LRU (least recently used) cache-invalidation functionality has been added to the default TTL (time to live). This means that values will be cached for the specified duration; if the cache's max size is reached, cache values will be invalidated as necessary, starting with the oldest cached value.

#### Modifying cache options

Default cache TTL and maximum size can be changed by setting values in the `$settings` argument array.

* Default maximum cache size: 4096 (multiples of 2 are recommended to increase efficiency)
* Default TTL: 24 hours (in seconds)

```
>>> $access_token = '123456789abc';
>>> $settings = ['cache_maxsize' => 30, 'cache_ttl' => 128];
>>> $client = new IPinfo($access_token, $settings);
```

#### Using a different cache

It's possible to use a custom cache by creating a child class of the [CacheInterface](https://github.com/ipinfo/php/blob/master/src/cache/Interface.php) class and passing this into the handler object with the `cache` keyword argument. FYI this is known as [the Strategy Pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/strategy).

```
>>> $access_token = '123456789abc';
>>> $settings = ['cache' => $my_fancy_custom_cache];
>>> $client = new IPinfo($access_token, $settings);
```

### Internationalization

When looking up an IP address, the response object includes a `Details->country_name` attribute which includes the country name based on American English. It is possible to return the country name in other languages by setting the `countries_file` keyword argument when creating the `IPinfo` object.

The file must be a `.json` file with the following structure:

```
{
 "BD": "Bangladesh",
 "BE": "Belgium",
 "BF": "Burkina Faso",
 "BG": "Bulgaria"
 ...
}
```

### Other Libraries

There are official IPinfo client libraries available for many languages including PHP, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, and many popular frameworks such as Django, Rails and Laravel. There are also many third party libraries and integrations available for our API.
